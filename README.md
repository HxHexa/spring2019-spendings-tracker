# spring2019-spendings-tracker
Final project for Bennington College's Data Structures in C++ course: a (hopefully) functional spendings tracking program. Inspired by the tiring work of having to keep my Excel spreadsheet updated.

So far only the basic structures are set up.

UPDATE: I probably will just leave the project as is and call it an implementation of a Hash Table in C++. Plans are that I will make this into an actual thing, but rebuilt from scratch using Python, since it is way easier there. It is not as if I would require C++ for this offline program for personal use anyways, though if I were to expand it...

Anyways, those thoughts are for a future far away. Right now, it would make way more sense to just build the program in Python to get a functioning version of it out quicker instead of having to worry about the little things. Have the structure done first then worry about the polishing later, I suppose?
